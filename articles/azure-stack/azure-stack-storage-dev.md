# <a name="get-started-with-azure-stack-storage-development-tools"></a>Get started with Azure Stack Storage development tools 

Microsoft Azure Stack provides a set of storage services, including Azure Blob, Table, and Queue storage.

This article provides quick guidance on how to start using Azure Stack Storage development tools. You can find more detailed information and sample code in the corresponding Azure Storage tutorials.

There are known differences between Azure Storage and Azure Stack Storage, including some specific requirements for each platform. For example, there are specific client libraries and specific endpoint suffix requirements for Azure Stack. For more information, see [Azure Stack Storage: Differences and considerations](azure-stack-acs-differences.md).

## <a name="azure-client-libraries"></a>Azure client libraries
The supported REST API version for Azure Stack Storage is 2015-04-05. It doesn’t have full parity with the latest version of the Azure Storage REST API. So for the storage client libraries, you need to be aware of the version that is compatible with REST API 2015-04-05.


|Client library|Azure Stack supported version|Link|Endpoint specification|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|.NET     |6.2.0|[https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/releases/tag/v6.2.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/releases/tag/v6.2.1)|app.config file|
|Node.js     |1.1.0|[https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/releases/tag/1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/releases/tag/1.1.0)|Service instance declaration|
|Python     |0.30.0|[https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python/releases/tag/v0.30.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python/releases/tag/v0.30.0)|Service instance declaration|

## <a name="endpoint-declaration"></a>Endpoint declaration
An Azure Stack endpoint includes two parts: the name of a region and the Azure Stack domain.
In the Azure Stack Development Kit, the default endpoint is **local.azurestack.external**.
Contact your cloud administrator if you’re not sure about your endpoint.

## <a name="examples"></a>Examples


### <a name="net"></a>.NET

For Azure Stack, the endpoint suffix is specified in the app.config file:

```
<add key="StorageConnectionString" 
value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=mykey;
EndpointSuffix=local.azurestack.external;" />
```

### <a name="nodejs"></a>Node.js

For Azure Stack, the endpoint suffix is specified in the declaration instance:

```
var blobSvc = azure.createBlobService('myaccount', 'mykey',
'myaccount.blob.local.azurestack.external');
```

### <a name="python"></a>Python

For Azure Stack, the endpoint suffix is specified in the declaration instance:

```
block_blob_service = BlockBlobService(account_name='myaccount',
account_key='mykey',
endpoint_suffix='local.azurestack.external')
```

## <a name="blob-storage"></a>Blob storage
